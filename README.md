# In Depth Neighbours Seeker Algorithm Visualizer
Visualizer of what I'm calling **In Depth Neighbors Seeker** Algorithm üòÖ

### Why?
I've discovered [this](https://youtu.be/4tYoVx0QoN0) challenge and I just wanted to solve it by myself, after ~5 hours I came up with this solution.
I don't have any experience with algorithms, so maybe I've just recreated something that already exists, but I still feel very proud of myself for successfully completing this challenge.

#### Challenge
The challenge is pretty simple, there is a matrix filled with 0 and 1, our goal is to retrieve only the 1 which are **vertically** or **orizontally** connected, but the connection **must start from a border**. Then just remove the 1 which are not connected.<br>
(*Even if the algorithms returns the matrix correctly, I've decided to leave the unlinked islands in order to better see the action behind the scenes*)

This
```
100111
101010
011100
100000
011010
010000
```

Would become
```
100111
100010
000000
100000
011000
010000
```

If it would have been processed with the visualizer

### Visualizer
After seeing some cool folks building some amazing algorithms visualizers, I decided to do the same, and I had a lot of fun during the process üòÅ
